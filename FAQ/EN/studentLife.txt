Q:
How to travel from Kuala Lumpur to Johor?

A:
The optimal way to get from Kuala Lumpur to Johor:

Through the bus station at Kuala Lumpur Airport. On the ground floor, just across the street from the airport, ask the staff at these stations in order:

Taman University terminal
Skudai bus stop
Tun Amina
Larkin
If you can't find a ticket at the first station, go to the second one, and so on. The ticket price ranges from 40 to 60 Ringgit.

If you can't find a ticket for these destinations, start by taking a bus from the airport to Kuala Lumpur's main bus terminal, called TBS, for 12 Ringgit. From there, you can book a ticket to Johor for the same mentioned stations above. This is the cheapest and safest option, and it is commonly used by students.

Safe travels to everyone.
